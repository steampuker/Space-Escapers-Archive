You are an astronaut
You've been crashed on the moon crater
You have crops
You have Fred, who can help you escape (fart fly)
You have to feed Fred for him to develop and fly
You have limited hunger, so you have to feed yourself too
You have insanity meter, stress and such will increase it:
	0 - fully sane, can proceed with regular tasks
	1 - slightly insane, you can cry to reduce it (doing nothing but increasing hunger)
	2 - moderately insane, will have breakdowns from time to time
	3 - very insane, will be walking slower (can be achieved by Fred crying)
	4 - super insane, reaching this level will allow you to end the game using loop ending 
	(can be achieved only by making your days the same, same one crop)
Hunger can be reduced by eating
Sanity can be retrieved by crying, calling family and baking a cake

When Fred develops, you can fly on his fart power, ending the game
The game map will have the rotated 8 shape, one part is Fred, another is workbench, where you can
combine DNAs and crops to get better quality food.
